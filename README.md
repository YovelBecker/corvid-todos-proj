# Corvid Todos Project

Try referencing to this code whenever needed while getting familiar with corvid.

## Installation

In order to get this Corvid app on your machine use 
 ```bash
npx create-corvid-app <folder-name> https://yovelb10.wixsite.com/tasker
```

[Here](https://support.wix.com/en/article/working-with-the-corvid-cli) 
is a good article about using the Corvid CLI to see a Corvid app code.


## Usage

Use this repository as your main reference to a corvid project and try not to get stuck in the Corvid CLI (better off using the web editor of your website)

Your main focus would be in the ```src``` folder there you would want to look at the ```.wix``` files. These are the files seen on the corvid editor.
